        I’m a self-taught full-stack developer with a background in construction and cost engineering.
        Transitioning into tech, I’ve built full-stack apps using React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
        My approach blends structured workflows, stakeholder collaboration, and an eye for detail—skills
        refined over 4+ years in project delivery roles. I’m passionate about learning, building, and
        solving real-world problems through code.
